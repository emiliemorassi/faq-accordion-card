## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

No need for JavaScript to make a FAQ Accordion.
Somehow I didn't know the details and summary tags.
Very easy to use and style.

### Continued development

Had a hard time figuring out the positioning of the box image so it didn't move when resizing the page. So, positioning is propably a good thing to keep an eye on for now.
First time using webpack. Not really needed here but it was a good exercise to understand how it all works. My biggest problem was to make it work with github pages.
Also, more efficient and clean commits would be nice.
